# THIRD_PARTY — Bundled components and license compliance

MoonLit is `GPL-3.0-only` (see `LICENSE`). This file tracks every third-party
component shipped inside MoonLit installers and what the GPL requires for each.

## gpu-screen-recorder (Linux capture engine)

- **What:** `gpu-screen-recorder` CLI + `gsr-kms-server` helper, built with
  `-Dcapabilities=false -Dffmpeg_static=true` (same recipe as upstream Flathub).
- **Upstream:** https://git.dec05eba.com/gpu-screen-recorder/ by dec05eba.
- **License:** `GPL-3.0-only` (per Arch, Alpine, Artix packaging). Compatible:
  MoonLit as a whole is GPL-3.0-only.
- **Pinned source (CI builds from this):**
  GitHub mirror `https://github.com/antonlobanovskiy/gpu-screen-recorder`
  (upstream git is bot-walled; mirror documents its upstream base commit)
  at commit `a2cfc66419fd7c814ab46e330592c983404b059b` (base: upstream 5.15.1).
  Built via `build-aux/build-gsr.sh` (meson release, `-Dcapabilities=false
  -Dsystemd=false -Dnvidia_suspend_fix=false -Dstrip=true`), output tagged
  with the rustc target triple under `src-tauri/binaries/<triple>/`.
  Bump the pin by updating `GSR_COMMIT` in that script.
- **Source offer (GPL §6):** Corresponding Source = pinned snapshot above
  plus our build flags (this file + the script). No modifications to GSR itself.
- **Ship model per format:**
  - `.rpm` / `.deb` / `.AppImage`: prebuilt sidecar under
    `<app>/moonlit-gsr/`; system deps (`libdrm`, `libva`, pipewire, pulse)
    come from official distro repos via `Requires`/`Depends`.
  - Flatpak/Flathub: `gpu-screen-recorder` compiled as a manifest module
    (mirrors upstream manifest), `finish-args: --device=all
    --socket=pulseaudio --socket=wayland --socket=fallback-x11`.
  - Windows: not shipped (native WGC/AMF/NVENC APIs instead).
- **Runtime resolution order:** `MOONLIT_GSR_BIN` override → bundled sidecar
  → system `PATH` → clear error. Dev machines use a native install
  (Terra/COPR rpm on Fedora); end users never install anything extra.
- **Windows ships NO GSR.** Capture there is native (WGC/DXGI + WASAPI, see
  `09_WINDOWS_HANDOFF.md`); `os::backend_binary` reports that by design.
  The only Windows sidecar is static FFmpeg (BtbN).

## FFmpeg (editor pipeline)

- **What:** `ffmpeg` CLI sidecar for thumbnails, lossless cuts, vertical presets.
- **Upstream:** https://ffmpeg.org (static builds: BtbN for Windows,
  johnvansickle musl for Linux).
- **License:** the static builds we ship (BtbN for Windows, johnvansickle
  musl for Linux) are GPL builds — they link `libx264`/`libx265`, which
  MoonLit needs for the `x264` CPU fallback codec (Windows `offered_codecs`
  always lists it; save-time `TranscodeEncoder::X264` maps to `libx264`).
  This is compliant because MoonLit as a whole is already `GPL-3.0-only`
  (via GSR, above). FFmpeg stays a separate process (CLI boundary); no
  libx264 code is linked into MoonLit itself.
- **Dev fallback:** system `ffmpeg` from `PATH` when no sidecar is present,
  with a log warning. Production always ships the pinned sidecar.

## Reference code (NOT shipped)

- Cap (AGPL-3.0) and LosslessCut (GPL-3.0): architecture/FFmpeg-args reference
  only. No code copied. If any snippet is ever adapted, its origin and license
  must be recorded here.
